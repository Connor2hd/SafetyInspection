# Warning
This project is not live.  I had it running on a local development environment and still need to make some alterations in order to have it viewable easily over the web.  I will have a demo hosted on Azure online very soon.

# NiagaraSafety
This project was created by myself for a class at the Computer Programmer Analyst program at Niagara College.  This was the final project in year two
and mostly focused on building upon C# and Asp.Net skills we learned in class the following semester.

### Tools and Technology Implemented
The websites design is a modified version of the open source [Gentelella Theme](https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella) which uses default
Bootstrap 3 alongside a variety of jQuery plugins.  Overall the design is very clean and simple, making it ideal to use in this quick
project.

The web application is built using ASP.NET Webforms within Visual Studio 2015.  All the code behind the application is C#.  

The web application connects to an Azure SQL Server using ADO.NET.
