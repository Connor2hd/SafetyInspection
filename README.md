# NiagaraSafety
Update May 2019: I just took a look at this for the first time since college and I noticed a lot of code that could have been written better.  I'm going to keep the repo public but it is not a good indication of my current skill level.

This project was created by myself for a class at the Computer Programmer Analyst program at Niagara College.  This was the final project in year two and mostly focused on building upon C# and Asp.Net skills we learned in class the following semester.

The web application allows a user to create, edit and delete safety inspections.  The inspections take a variety of information and store it in a database.  There is quite a variety of information that can be manipulated.

### Status
This project is mostly completed.  There are a couple things I would like to work on and improve but as for functionality it is pretty much where I want it.  I would like to play with some Javascript libraries for a chart solution, work on reporting and graphs a bit more.  There is some code I would like to make more efficient and tidy up a bit.

### Tools and Technology Implemented
The websites design is a modified version of the open source [Gentelella Theme](https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella) which uses default
Bootstrap 3 alongside a variety of jQuery plugins.  Overall the design is very clean and simple, making it ideal to use in this quick
project.

The web application is built using ASP.NET Webforms within Visual Studio.  All the code behind the application is C#.  

The web application connects to an Azure SQL Server using ADO.NET.
